=========

trilobyte is a proxy server that analyzes your online activity and serves back personalized metrics about your data privacy. The score is calculated by comparing the data from companies' transparency reports with the websites you're accessing, data about your government's perceived corruption index and the countries that your web traffic goes through.

It was implemented as part of a 24 hour hacking challenge at the EUHackathon 2013.
